They verify the authenticity of a non-fungible asset, which makes these assets unique and one of a kind. For example, investing in a Picasso piece of art. There can be multiple copies of his art but only one original piece. That is what makes the original painting valuable and irreplaceable.\",\n" +
            "          \"t2\": \"NFTs are different from cryptocurrency in the manner that you can exchange cryptocurrency to purchase valuable products, so they are fungible that way. NFTs are not, and that is why they are such a huge investment tool.\\n\\nOther factors that make NFTs such valuable investments are utility, ownership history, underlying value, perception of the buyer, liquidity premium and future value.\",\n" +

            "          \"t1\": \"One NFT collector paid \$69.3 million for the digital artwork titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” by Mike Winkelmann, also known as Beeple, making this NFT the most expensive in the history of crypto art. The CryptoPunks collection consists of 10,000 pixelated images of punks with a set of unique characteristics, which pioneered in 2015 on the Ethereum blockchain, sells for thousands of dollars. \\n\\nThe question arises: What is the value of these digital creations and why are collectors spending so much money on them?\\n\\nBeeple’s “Everydays,” a collage of 5,000 drawings referencing every day for the past thirteen-and-a-half years, was an arduous task. However, many NFT collections, which are incredibly successful, most likely do not require a particularly complex contribution from the author. \\n\\nTherefore, for anyone who wants to become an NFT artist, it is somewhat necessary to have a goal in mind and a great level of creativity. Even for those who are not as skilled as Leonardo da Vinci but have a bunch of ideas, creating an NFT is undoubtedly worth trying. Moreover, for artists by occupation who most likely already have several Beeple-like artworks that are idle in the digital studio and just waiting in the wings to be sold as NFTs, this could be a great point to start. \\n\\nTruthfully, an unknown person's innovative and appealing digital art piece will not reach the level of a craze as celebrities' creations like Canadian singer Grimes’ 10 digital paintings which have been sold for about \$6 million, NFT releases from Kings of Leon which has generated \$2 million in sales, or an exciting NFT which presents Jack Dorsey's very first tweet, which has been sold for more than \$3 million. \\n\\nAfter all, NFT technology is ideal for preserving scarcity and establishing ownership of digital and tangible assets. It offers digital creators solid options for monetizing their work and a level of flexibility that is often lacking in the traditional creative industry's models. Attaching digital content to the blockchain as a nonfungible token is a safe and verifiable way to sell it online. Furthermore, NFT creation offers artists unlimited access to a global network of collectors and like-minded people. \\n\\nFortunately, the process of creating an NFT is neither costly, complex nor technical. Without writing any codes and with the right guide, anyone can create an NFT.\",\n" +
            "          \"t2\": \"The process of creating a nonfungible token is called minting. The term refers to the process of turning a digital item into an asset on the blockchain. Similar to how metal coins are created and added into circulation, NFTs are minted once they are created. After the process, the digital item becomes tamper-proof, more secure and difficult to manipulate. Since it is represented as a nonfungible token, it can then be purchased and traded, as well as digitally tracked when it is resold or collected again in the future.\",\n" +
